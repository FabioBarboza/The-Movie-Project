## Third-Party Libraries
### Alamofire
[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) is an HTTP networking library written in Swift. It leverages NSURLSession and the Foundation URL Loading System to provide first-class networking capabilities in a convenient Swift interface.
#### Usage - Making a Request



```swift
import Alamofire

Alamofire.request("https://httpbin.org/get")
```

#### Response Handling

Handling the `Response` of a `Request` made in Alamofire involves chaining a response handler onto the `Request`.

```swift
Alamofire.request("https://httpbin.org/get").responseJSON { response in
    print(response.request)  // original URL request
    print(response.response) // HTTP URL response
    print(response.data)     // server data
    print(response.result)   // result of response serialization

    if let JSON = response.result.value {
        print("JSON: \(JSON)")
    }
}
```
